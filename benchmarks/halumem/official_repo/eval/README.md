# Evaluation — Memory Systems with HaluMem

This folder contains the evaluation toolkit for measuring hallucination and memory performance of different memory systems on the **HaluMem** benchmark.

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

```bash
# 1. enter eval folder
cd eval

# 2. install dependencies (Poetry)
poetry install --with eval
```

> If you prefer `pip` or `conda`, install the packages listed in `pyproject.toml` accordingly.

## ⚙️ Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file and fill in your own keys and service endpoints:

```bash
cp .env-example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` to include the required configurations for your setup.
   The key parameters are grouped as follows:

> 💡 Tip:
>
> * If you're evaluating only one specific memory system (e.g., Mem0), you can omit the configuration settings for all other systems.
> * For local deployments, ensure corresponding services are running before evaluation.

## 🔧 Local deployments (Memobase)

For Memobase we rely on local/service deployments. See these projects for install & runtime instructions:

* Memobase: [https://github.com/memodb-io/memobase](https://github.com/memodb-io/memobase)

Make sure the services are running and the corresponding endpoints are reachable before running the evaluation scripts.

## 📁 Supported Memory System Wrappers

The repo includes evaluation adapters for multiple memory systems. Filenames map to system wrappers:

* `eval_memzero.py` — Mem0 (default)
* `eval_memzero_graph.py` — Mem0 (Graph variant)
* `eval_memos.py` — MemOS
* `eval_memobase.py` — Memobase
* `eval_zep.py` — Zep
* `eval_supermemory.py` — SuperMemory

Each adapter follows the same input / output contract so the downstream scorer can compare systems fairly.

## 🧪 Running the Evaluation

To evaluate memory systems using **HaluMem**, execute the following commands step by step:

1. Generate run artifacts (extract memories & generate predictions): using **Mem0** as an example, first run the following command to process dialogue input, extract memory points, and perform QA retrieval.

   ```bash
   python eval_memzero.py
   ```

   Please set data_path and version in eval_memzero.py as needed:
   * `data_path` : path to dataset
   * `version` : evaluation version identifier (used to tag outputs)

   Specifically, for Zep, due to its asynchronous design, we provide an additional `run_task` argument in `eval_zep.py` to specify either the dialogue addition task (`run_task="add"`) or the memory retrieval task (`run_task="search"`, which includes both memory update and QA retrieval). The dialogue addition task must be executed first, and once the dialogue processing is complete (progress can be monitored via threads and episodes on the official platform), the memory retrieval task can then be performed.

2. Score & aggregate results: run the following command to evaluate **Mem0** on memory extraction, memory update, and memory QA tasks, and aggregate the results.

   ```bash
   python evaluation.py --frame memzero --version default
   ```

   * `--frame` : which adapter/system frame to evaluate (e.g., `memzero`, `memos`, `memobase`)
   * `--version` : same identifier used during run generation

3. Outputs: the final results will be saved in the `results` folder.
   

These artifacts enable reproducibility and further analysis (error inspection, evidence linking, per-memory-point breakdowns).

## Special Configurations for Some Memory Systems

While the experimental setup strives to maintain consistent configurations across all evaluated systems, certain memory systems exhibit unique API constraints that necessitate specific adjustments or workarounds.
Each subsection below outlines these system-specific configurations to ensure reproducibility.

#### Memobase

Since Memobase does not provide a Get Dialogue Memory API, we adopted a localized deployment approach and directly accessed the corresponding dialogue memories from its underlying database. Additionally, the Retrieve Memory API of Memobase only supports controlling the maximum length of the returned memory text. Based on test results, we set the maximum length for memory recall in the memory updating task to 250 tokens and the recall length for the memory question answering task to 500 tokens.

#### Zep

According to our current understanding, the official APIs provided by Zep do not support retrieving all memory points within a specific session, meaning they do not offer functionality equivalent to a Get Dialogue Memory API. Consequently, we were unable to evaluate Zep’s performance on the memory extraction task. We attempted to use the function `thread.get_user_context()` offered by Zep to obtain all memories under a given thread; however, this method only returns recent memories rather than the complete set, which does not meet the evaluation requirements. Moreover, since Zep’s memory processing workflow operates entirely asynchronously, we could not accurately measure the time consumption in the dialogue addition phase and instead recorded only the time cost associated with memory retrieval.

Therefore, the evaluation metrics of the *memory extraction* task (`memory_accuracy` and `memory_recall`) and the *dialogue addition time* obtained after running `eval_zep.py` and `evaluation.py` cannot accurately reflect the actual performance of Zep.
